# Summary

Built a web application that scrapes various websites for data related to the Mission to Mars and displays the information in a single HTML page. Collected and displayed web articles, headings, and images. Used jupyter notebook, beautifulSoup, Pandas, MongoDb, Flask, and Splinter to help create this project. The data used is from the NASA Mars News Site. Once on the webpage through deploying the Flask app, you are able to navigate the page by clicking on various images or the dashboard.
